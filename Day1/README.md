# Day 1 â€“ Introduction to Verilog RTL Design & Synthesis  

Welcome to **Day 1 of the Digital VLSI SoC RTL Design Workshop**.  
In this session, we focus on writing Verilog code, simulating with **Icarus Verilog**, analyzing results with **GTKWave**, and synthesizing RTL designs using **Yosys** and the **Sky130 PDK**.  
This README provides both **conceptual insights** and **hands-on lab instructions** with step-by-step commands.

## Verilog & Testbench Basics  

Verilog is a Hardware Description Language (HDL) used to model digital circuits.  
A **design** represents the actual circuit logic, while a **testbench** is written to verify and validate that the design behaves as expected.  
Simulators like **Icarus Verilog** mimic how the hardware would behave before fabrication, saving time and cost.

## Lab Work with Icarus Verilog & GTKWave  

Clone the Workshop Repository  
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/kunalg123/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop.git  
$ cd sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/verilog_files  
```
![Alt Text](Images/clone_repo.png)

This repository contains sample Verilog files, testbenches, and standard libraries that will be used throughout the workshop.  

 Explore Files & Check the following folders: lib, my_lib, verilog_files.
  ![Alt Text](Images/file_check_repo.png)
  
This ensures you know where libraries, RTL files, and testbenches are located.  

Simulate the Design 
```bash
$ iverilog good_mux.v tb_good_mux.v  
$ ./a.out  
$ gtkwave tb_good_mux.vcd
```

Here, the design file and testbench are compiled, executed, and visualized using GTKWave.  
GTKWave allows you to inspect the waveforms and confirm the logic behavior cycle by cycle.  

![Alt Text](Images/GTK_simulation.png)

Open Files in Editor  
``` 
$ gvim tb_good_mux.v -o good_mux.v
```

Opening both design and testbench together allows side-by-side debugging and easier correlation of inputs and outputs.

## Introduction to Yosys (Logic Synthesizer)  

Yosys is an open-source logic synthesis tool that converts RTL Verilog into a **gate-level netlist**.  
It ensures that the Verilog code is implementable in real hardware by mapping it to a set of standard cells from the process technology library.  
This step bridges the gap between abstract RTL and physical chip implementation.  

---

## Understanding .lib Files  

A `.lib` file describes the timing, power, and functional characteristics of standard cells used in a process technology (e.g., Sky130).  
Different cells (slow, fast, low-power) allow designers to balance **speed, area, and power consumption**.  
During synthesis, Yosys consults these libraries to choose the most suitable gates for the given design constraints.  

---

## Lab Work with Yosys  

Start Yosys 
``` bash
$ yosys
``` 
This command launches the Yosys interactive shell where synthesis steps are executed.  

Read the Liberty Library
```bash
$ read_liberty -lib ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib  
$ The library provides the characteristics of gates used during synthesis.  
```
Read the Verilog Design 
```bash
$ read_verilog verilog_files/good_mux.v
```
This loads the design file into Yosys for processing.  

Synthesize the Top Module 
```
$ synth -top good_mux
```

Here Yosys synthesizes the specified top module and prepares it for technology mapping.

Map RTL to Standard Cells  
```
$ abc -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
``` 
This step maps abstract RTL logic into real standard cells defined in the `.lib` file.  

Visualize the Logic  
```
$ show
```
Generates a schematic of the synthesized design, showing how logic gates are interconnected.  

![Alt Text](Images/yosys_schematic.png)

Write the Netlist  
```
$ write_verilog good_mux_netlist.v
```
Saves the synthesized gate-level representation of the design in Verilog format.  

Open the Netlist  
```
$ !gvim good_mux_netlist.v
```
Review the generated netlist to understand how your design has been transformed into gates.  
Generate Simplified Netlist  
```
$ write_verilog -noattr good_mux_netlist.v  
$ !gvim good_mux_netlist.v
```
![Alt Text](Images/yosys_netlist_simple.png)
Creates a cleaner netlist without unnecessary attributes for easier readability.

## Outcome  

By the end of **Day 1**, I successfully:  
- Learned the fundamentals of **Verilog RTL design** and the role of **testbenches** in simulation.  
- Simulated Verilog code using **Icarus Verilog** and verified outputs with **GTKWave waveforms**.  
- Performed **logic synthesis** using **Yosys** and mapped designs to the **Sky130 PDK standard cells**.  
- Understood the role of **.lib files** and how synthesis tools optimize for performance and power.  

This completed the **end-to-end RTL Design Flow**:  
**Verilog Design â†’ Testbench â†’ Simulation â†’ Synthesis â†’ Gate-Level Netlist**
